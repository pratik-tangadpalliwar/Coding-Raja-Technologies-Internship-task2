## Pratik's Music Player - Second Internship Project

This project is a Music Player I created during my internship with Coding Raja. It allows users to listen to their favorite music tracks. The application features playlist management, a music library, audio controls, a progress bar, shuffle and repeat options, and a responsive design to ensure it works well on various screen sizes.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pratik-tangadpalliwar/Coding-Raja-Technologies-Internship-task2.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
 
   npm install

3. **Start the server:**

    node server.js



**Features:**

* **Playlist Management**: Allows users to create and manage playlists.
* **Music Library**: Displays a library of available tracks with album covers and artist names.
* **Audio Controls**: Implements play, pause, next, previous, and volume controls.
* **Progress Bar**: Shows the progress of the currently playing track.
* **Shuffle and Repeat**:** Includes options to shuffle and repeat tracks.
* **Responsive Design**: Ensures the app works well on various screen sizes. 

**Technology Stack:**

* HTML5: For structuring the web page content.
* CSS3: For styling the web page to make it visually appealing and responsive.
* JavaScript: For handling the audio playback, user interactions, and dynamic content updates.
* Node.js: For creating a backend server.
* Express.js: A web framework for Node.js used to serve static files and handle HTTP requests.

I hope this project serves as a good starting point for my web development journey!
